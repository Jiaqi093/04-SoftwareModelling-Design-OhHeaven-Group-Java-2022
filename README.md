# 04-SoftwareModelling-Design-OhHeaven-Group-Java-2022

This project is fully written in Java.
A card game called “Hearts” is developed. However this project is not focusing on the Java programming, I was mainly using the GRASP principles and GoF design patterns to achieve the high cohesion and low coupling of this project. The detail of explanations on GRASP and GoF is provided in the report -> report.pdf.

Overall, Heart is a card game with four players in total. I designed two normal NPC who can simply playing the cards correctly, one advanced NPC who can choose different playing card strategies under different conditions, and one player allowing human to control. Please also check the diagrams in the report file which gives the overall idea on how I designed the game.
